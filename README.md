# Trimble App Xchange Connector for Pinecone

## Overview
The Trimble App Xchange Connector for Pinecone provides a seamless way to integrate Pinecone's vector database capabilities into your workflows. This connector simplifies the process of generating vector embeddings from your cached data, creating and managing vector indexes, and upserting data into the Pinecone vector database. 

By leveraging this connector, you can unlock the potential of your data for applications like:

- **Semantic Search**: Enable powerful search capabilities based on contextual meaning.
- **Change Detection**: Track changes in your data over time.
- **Business Insights**: Gain actionable insights through data analysis.

Pinecone's fully managed vector database ensures automatic scaling, eventual consistency, and data persistence.
